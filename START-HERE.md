## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: How long will this take?**
A: 6-8 weeks for Phase 1 (pilot → beta → company rollout). Phase 2 adds 1-2 weeks if approved.

**Q: How much IT time is needed?**
A: ~50-70 hours over 6 weeks. Breakdown:
- Pre-launch: 15 hours
- Pilot: 10-15 hours
- Beta: 8-12 hours
- Rollout: 20-25 hours

**Q: What if no one uses it?**
A: Pilot and beta phases (weeks 1-3) identify adoption issues early. Can stop before company rollout if not working.

**Q: Is this secure?**
A: Yes. Script runs in user's Google authorization, no external APIs, data stays in Google Workspace, code is transparent.

**Q: Can we customize it?**
A: Yes! You have full source code. Common customizations: file naming, markdown format, export formats.

**Q: What's the ROI?**
A: If 100 users adopt and save 1 hour/month each:
- Value: $60,000/year (@ $50/hr)
- Cost: ~$5,000 IT time (@ $75/hr × 70 hrs)
- **ROI: 12x in year 1**

**Q: Why not just deploy the add-on (Phase 2) immediately?**
A: Phase 1 proves adoption and value before investing in add-on development. Also allows time to refine documentation and gather feedback.
